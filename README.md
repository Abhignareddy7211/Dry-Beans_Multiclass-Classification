# Dry-Beans_Multiclass-Classification
This repository contains code for building an effective classification model that can accurately identify and classify 7 types of Drybeans based on their physical characteristics and properties.All the models used were implemented from Scratch.

Currently, 3 algorithms have been used for Classification:
1)Logistic Regression
2)Support Vector Machines
3)Neural Networks

The data for the analysis is taken from UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository's
Dry Beans Dataset:- https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset

This work has been done as part of the (IE 7300)Machine Learning course.
